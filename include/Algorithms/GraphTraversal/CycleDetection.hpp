 *     method. Note that a cycle detection can only be if the target vertex
 *     was already visited, but not processed. This represent the second
 *     branch in the if condition of the @p breakable_for_all_edges_at.
 *
 * @tparam     GraphType  The graph should at least provide the same interface
 *     as the StaticGraph().
 * @tparam     IsDirected  If @p true the graph is treated as a directed graph,
 *     if @p false the graph is treated as an undirected graph.
